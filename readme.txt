Simulator to analyze workload placement algorithms on cloud servers based on bin-packing problem
Simulating and comparing the algorithms with each other
Take into account different dimensions such as CPU utilization, Network Bandwidth, RAM, Disk Space 

Objectives of the simulator were:
Evaluation of “preciousness” of a resource in optimality of placement for resources
Identification of scope of improvement in existing workload placement algorithms
